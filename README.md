Welcome to Jim's Toolbox Read me.
I started creating the Toolbox as a tool for re-installing my windows, so I don't have to look all over the place for programs, settings, and hacks.
The project has since expanded and I have also started sharing the project. It has become a hobby. I am not a professional programmer. So I try to 
keep expanding to make a re-install quicker and easier but also try to add tools for fixing your install. And when I run into a handy registry hack or
fix I add it too. 

Thank you for your interest. If you would like to support me you can provide me with comments and requests and if you feel like doing a big thing you can buy me a coffee.

Enjoy the Toolbox.

Disclaimer: With using Jim's Toolbox you accept that I am not responsible for any harm to your system. This includes blowing up your computer, Deleting system files, and Corrupting your HDD or SDD. This program is as it is.
There is no guarantee. There is a reason why I add the notion that a program or function can be dangerous.

Important: I check the program with Totalvirus before uploading and it is always reported clean! Some anti-virus programs can give a false positive due to the elevated Admin rights

ATTENTION: Jim's Toolbox V6.1 is being flagged by Defender with a False Posıtıve as they have blacklisted the Windows Activation script! So don't worry about it. I might remove the script with the next version
