Welcome to the Jim's Toolbox Read me.
I started creating the Toolbox as a tool for re-installing my windows , so I don't have to look all over the place for programs, settings and hacks.
The project has since expanded and I have also started sharing the project. It has become a hobby. I am not a proffessional programer. So I try to 
keep expanding to make a re-install quicker and easier but also try to add tools for fixing your install. And when I run in to a handy registry hack or
fix I add it too. 

Thank you for your interest. If you would like to support me you can provide me with comments and requests and if you really feel like doing a big thing you can buy me a coffee.

Enjoy the Toolbox.
